    Seeing RHO as a unique name, I checked up the Japanese vocabulary to see if anything matches the pronunciation - and I found a Hiragana letter for it. I also used the symbol of a 5-petal sakura flower as the composition for my logo.

    The concept is “preserving memories”, this is inspired from the idea of diaries and documentaries. Diaries are written and documentaries are recorded because they represent something meaningful to someone or to capture an important event or occasion. I want parents to cherish present time with kids by photographing them, hence the memory will never be lost.

    Based on infusing Malay words as well as establishing a relationship between us and the customers. Malay were used as it represents our national language, where “kamu” means “you”; “kami” meaning “we” or “us”. The name later changed to “ROJAK” for our art bazaar because it indicates different personalities, selling different products with different styles just like the traditional delicacy comprised of mixed fruits and ingredients.
